# Operator

## Operators in Java
Operator in Java is a symbol that is used to perform operations.  
There are many types of operators in Java which are given below:
Here is a brief introduction to Java operators:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**:  
   Perform basic mathematical operations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulus (`%`).

2. **Relational Operators**:  
   Compare two values, resulting in a boolean (`true` or `false`). Examples include `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`.

3. **Logical Operators**:  
   Used to combine multiple boolean expressions. Common operators are `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT).

4. **Bitwise Operators**:  
   Operate on bits of integers. Includes `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT), `<<` (left shift), `>>` (right shift).

5. **Assignment Operators**:  
   Assign values to variables. The basic operator is `=`, and combined operators include `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.

6. **Unary Operators**:  
   Operate on a single operand. Includes increment (`++`), decrement (`--`), positive (`+`), and negative (`-`).

7. **Ternary Operator**:  
   A shorthand for `if-else` condition. Syntax: `condition ? expr1 : expr2`.

8. **Instanceof Operator**:  
   Tests whether an object is an instance of a specific class or subclass. Syntax: `obj instanceof ClassName`.
