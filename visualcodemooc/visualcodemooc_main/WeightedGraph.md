# Weighted Graph

## Introduction to Weighted Graph

In a Weighted Graph, every edge is endowed with a specific value or attribute, often referred to as its weight. This weight can represent various metrics such as distance, cost, time, or any other quantitative measure. It is typically denoted by w(e), where e stands for an edge. The weight is instrumental in determining the expense or cost associated with moving from one vertex to another within the graph. The following illustration provides a visual representation of a graph where each edge is marked with its respective weight, signifying the cost of traversal between connected vertices.
