## Java String

In Java, a **String** is a sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. Strings are immutable, meaning once created, their value cannot be changed. They are objects of the `String` class, which provides various methods for string manipulation, such as concatenation, comparison, substring extraction, and more.

## String Basics  
**Creating Strings**:  
Strings can be created using string literals or by using the `new` keyword.
```java
String greeting = "Hello, World!";
String anotherGreeting = new String("Hello, World!");
```

**Common String Methods**:  
- `length()`: Returns the length of the string.  
- `substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)`: Returns a part of the string.  
- `equals(Object obj)`: Compares two strings for equality.  
- `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`: Converts the string to uppercase or lowercase.  

Java strings are widely used for handling textual data, and their immutability ensures safety and efficiency in many programming scenarios.
