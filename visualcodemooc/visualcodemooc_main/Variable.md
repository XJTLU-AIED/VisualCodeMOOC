# Variable  

## Introduction to Variables
A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type.

Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.

There are two types of data types in Java: **primitive** and **non-primitive**.


## Types of Variables in Java
There are three types of variables in Java:

**local variable:**   
Defined within a method, constructor, or block.  
Only accessible within the scope where it's declared.  
Not initialized automatically, so must be explicitly initialized before use.  

**instance variable:**   
Declared within a class but outside any method.  
Each object of the class has its own copy.  
Initialized automatically to default values if not explicitly initialized.  

**static variable:**   
Declared with the static keyword within a class.  
Shared across all instances of the class.  
Initialized automatically and only once when the class is loaded.
