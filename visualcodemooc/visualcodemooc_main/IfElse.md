# If-else

## Java if...else... statement
The if-else statement in Java is a control structure that allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block if the condition is false.   
It helps manage decision-making in programs by directing the flow based on conditions.  

## Syntax
The syntax is:
```java
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
```
This structure ensures that one of the two blocks is executed, depending on the evaluated condition.
