# For

## For loop in Java
The **for loop** in Java is a control structure used to repeatedly execute a block of code a specific number of times. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and update. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition is true. The syntax is:


## Syntax
```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed repeatedly
}
```

This structure is typically used for iterating over arrays, lists, or ranges of values, making it easy to manage repetitive tasks with a known iteration count.
