# Input and Output

## Java I/O
Java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output.  

Java uses the concept of a stream to make I/O operation fast. The java.io package contains all the classes required for input and output operations.  

## Stream
A stream is a flow of data. In Java, a stream consists of bytes and is named "stream" because it resembles a continuous flow of water. Java automatically provides three streams, all of which are connected to the console:

1) System.out: the standard output stream

2) System.in: the standard input stream

3) System.err: the standard error stream
