# While

## While Loop in Java

The **while loop** in Java is a control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Before each iteration, the condition is evaluated; if it's true, the loop continues, otherwise, it stops. The syntax is:

## Syntax

```java
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed repeatedly
}
```

The `while` loop is useful when the number of iterations isn't known beforehand, and you want to keep looping until a certain condition is met.
