## Introduction to Directed Graph

Directed Graph: A graph with edges that have a specific directionality is known as a directed graph. Here, arrows are used to represent the direction of the edges, indicating the flow from one node to another. It's important to note that in a directed graph, movement can be restricted to a single direction or allowed in both, as depicted in the accompanying diagram.
