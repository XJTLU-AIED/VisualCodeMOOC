        Given a directed graph, can check if there is cycle inside the graph using Depth First Search. 
                        The main procedure is like: 'Traverse all the nodes in the graph, track visited nodes and the path being traversed. 
                                                If a visited node is found in the path, it indicates that there is a cycle, otherwise, continue traversing.
